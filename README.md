<div style="text-align: justify">
This is a suite of useful tools for epitope prediction in viral organisms, which will allow users to easily and automatically deal with different common tasks within these big field, from target identification and selection to molecular docking studies. The main language is python, with some scripts in R, and therefore can be easily extended and modified.
